**Important Considerations:**

*   **Challenge Language:**  The challenge description is in French. Focus should be on universities with a significant French-speaking student body within France.
*   **Student Motivation:**  Target universities where students are encouraged to participate in extracurricular projects, innovation challenges, and career-enhancing activities.
*   **Location of Finale:** Paris (Final pitch in Paris - 13th arrondissement) - Universities closer to Paris or with good travel links might have slightly higher participation.
*   **University Ranking/Prestige:** Students from higher-ranked institutions and "Grandes Écoles" might be more driven by competition and career opportunities.

This list is a good starting point, covering a diverse range of university types and geographical locations within France.  The most relevant will likely be the **Business Schools** and **Top Engineering Schools** initially, but broadening to include **major public universities** and **specialized design/architecture schools** can capture a wider range of innovative ideas.
